## Learning Outcomes
After the session you will be able to:
* Record workflows for automation and documentation
* Explain the concepts of variables, for-loops, conditional statements, arrays – and use them within the ImageJ macro language.
* Modify ROIs within the ROI-Manager via scripting.
* Batch-execute code on all images of one folder.
* Independently explore new functionalities of ImageJ macro scripting within the Built-in macro functions.
* Create your own script to automate your workflows

## Prerequisites
To be able to follow the course you need to know basic image analysis concepts and how to apply them using Fiji:
* pixel scaling (pixel size)
* handling of multi-channel images
* segmentation by applying an global threshold
* “analyze particles” (connected component analysis)
* ROIs
* performing measurements
